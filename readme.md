* This is a **_proof of concept_**.
* It forms the basis of recommendations for architecture, patterns, dependencies, and has some of the characteristics which will eventually be present in FF hybrid apps.
However, __it lacks important functionality and checks__.
It does not conform to SOC1 or any other auditable process.
* We do not endorse any attempt to use this codebase as the blueprint for production code.
